# PathPredict Chatbot (Concept Project)

This is a beginner-friendly AI-inspired project where I am learning how to build a simple chatbot that asks users about:

• lifestyle
• symptoms
• family history
• health awareness

The goal of the chatbot is **not medical diagnosis**, but to:
✔ encourage preventive thinking  
✔ increase awareness  
✔ promote healthy habits  
✔ suggest when to consult a doctor  

This is an educational learning project while I study:
SQL • Python • HTML • CSS • JavaScript

I am slowly building this step-by-step as I learn programming.
