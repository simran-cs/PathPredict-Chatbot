\## Problem Statement



Many people have access to genetic and lifestyle-related data, but they lack clear, customized ways to interpret it for preventive health awareness. Most current healthcare strategies are reactive, and generic health recommendations often fail to account for individual risk patterns.



By responsibly and ethically integrating lifestyle factors with genetic risk concepts, PathPredict seeks to conceptually illustrate how AI systems could promote early awareness and preventive thinking.
