\## Status of the Project



PathPredict is currently in the early stages of documentation and prototype development. Rather than building a production-ready application, the project focuses on defining system architecture, ethical considerations, and conceptual AI reasoning.



At this stage, the core documentation has been established, and foundational elements are being prepared to support future prototype development and experimentation.
