\## Privacy, Ethics, and Disclaimer



Strong ethical and privacy considerations are central to the development of PathPredict. The project does not perform or claim any form of medical diagnosis, nor does it use real genetic or patient data.



The system is intended solely for research demonstration and educational purposes. Rather than replacing professional medical advice, it aims to raise awareness and encourage preventive thinking.



All concepts are presented responsibly, with a strong focus on user privacy, transparency, and the ethical use of artificial intelligence.
